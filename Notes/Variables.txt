is a place in memory - all over the RAM. Our OS figures that out for our program.
variables is a representation of something in memory - the way we do this, is by naming it something useful in our program.

= as a single operator, is an assignment operator

the name of the variable is the name of reserved memory

console is a variable, in memory, we then access it, and then we say .log, we are accessing this function inside of console

Arrays have properties, like length
arr[3] - is referring to accessing something in the array at a specific location of the array

() - overloaded case, log() - means execute a function, and it can also be used for grouping (i.e. in maths)
; - is a operator, part of the syntax, denoting that the statement is finished


Some operators can be used to do something to a variable and reassign the result back into the variable
age++ - will increment the age by 1
age =+ 2
