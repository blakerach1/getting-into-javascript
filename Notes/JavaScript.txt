JavaScript

Values
collection of values - arrays
collection of values - object - rather than values being at certain positions, value is stored at a specific location based on a key, a collection of key value pair


+ is referred to as overloaded, which means it has more than one behaviour depending on what values are involved
for example
string concatenation & adding numbers

operators and operands

! is a uniary operator
single operand involved in the operation
Like a !false - which flips the boolean

Comparison operators

== and ===
Type coersion

3.0 == 3 are the same kind of values, would return as true

true || false - is an or operator (two pipe characters put together)
If one or the other is true
&& - is an AND operator, would give us true if both of the operands are true
